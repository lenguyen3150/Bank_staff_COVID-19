# Bank_staff_COVID-19
# Description
This repository contains files for performing computational simulations of a hybrid system dynamics (SD) and agent-based (AB) model. The model simulates SARS-CoV-2 transmission across a network of heterogeneous care homes via bank/agency staff who work in multiple care homes. 

The code was developed for the analysis presented in the scientific paper "Hybrid simulation modelling networks of heterogeneous care homes and the inter-facility spread of Covid-19 by sharing staff" by Le Khanh Ngan Nguyen, Dr Itamar Megiddo, and Professor Susan Howick.

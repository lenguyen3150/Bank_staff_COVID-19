# Bank_staff_COVID-19
# Description
This repository contains files for performing computational simulations of a hybrid system dynamics (SD) and agent-based (AB) model. The model simulates SARS-CoV-2 transmission across a network of heterogeneous care homes via bank/agency staff who work in multiple care homes. 

The model was built in Anylogic PLE 8.7.5, a multimethod simulation modelling tool that combines graphical modelling and Java code, and analysis was carried out in R version 1.4.1717.

The model was developed for the analysis presented in the scientific paper "Hybrid simulation modelling networks of heterogeneous care homes and the inter-facility spread of Covid-19 by sharing staff" by Le Khanh Ngan Nguyen, Dr Itamar Megiddo, and Professor Susan Howick.
